Mod Prefixes:
	S0_			:	Only works on sv_pure 0|-1 servers, there's barely any servers that run pure 0 or -1 so don't bother.
	S1_			:	Might work on all sv_pure servers, but don't get your hopes up.
	S2_			:	Works everywhere.
	SV_			:	Valve server allows most if not all parts of the mod.
	SS_			:	Singleplayer only/Not needed or used in multiplayer.
	Mod_		:	Don't fully know what it reacts to, try for yourself.

Folders:
	DeltaMods	:	A mix and mash of different mods that would be a waste to put in a separate file.
					Or I might edit/replace the file every so often.

SV_PURE Info:
	Read [`DeltaMods/cfg/gfx/delta.cfg` > sv_pure {notes}] for more info on what sv_pure does.
